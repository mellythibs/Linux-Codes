.sh file that uses terms from one file to find them on the other file

As of right now his mini-code doesn't work 100% as I'm still creating it.
- I need to code the program to recognize terms that are both upper case and lower case
- I need to fix REG expression to find terms like 'C' which is just inputting something like [[:space:]] on both ends.
